# Learn software development the fun way: Build a communcations app from scratch 

Want to learn a new language in a fun way? Want to become a better developer doing that? Let's build a communications app starting with the description provided. 

By the time we finish building this, we'll be able to implement the following concepts and tech in whatever stack we're using:

- Backend Communcation Protocols
- GUIs/CLIs
- File Storage
- Databases
- Data Strctures
- Video/Audio Processing
- String processing
- File handling
- Image Preview
- DevOps: Build, Deploy and Diagnostics
and much more...


Google, ChatGPT or do whatever you want to search whenever stuck. Just make sure to properly understand if copying any code, using library, tools etc. happy coding!


User Requirements: 

- Send chat to A chatgroup ( 1 or more people ).
- Persist chat (for a specific chatroom and visible to subscribed user)
- Chat format: text, file(preview options for image), URL
- Audio/Video Calling, WIth screen sharing
- Browse the chat history, groups, call history etc.
- with GUI
- Settings, Call History etc.
- Chat backup and Migration Options

Technical Requirements:

- Languages (Make one version in each language): JS,Go, Python, C, Java, Rust, Zig etc.
- Identify how each toolâ€™s (language, library, Framework) used across the industry.
- Try to be less dependent on third party libraries, only use when absolutely requred. If you really use something, try to understand the internals, explore code etc,
- ** Setup Benchmark, Testcases, Dockerize, Build and Deployment Scripts, Diagnostics (Logging, Metrics, Audit etc.) **
- Once the initial prototype is complete, try deploying it over some free tier linux server, or any cheap linux service provider. Automate deployment by installing tools like jenkins(or use github workflows) on your local machine.
- Go over WebRTC: [https://webrtc.github.io/webrtc-org/architecture](https://webrtc.github.io/webrtc-org/architecture/#), and try to create something similar at lower levels
